However, a distinction is typically made between categorical variables with equal weight given to all possible categories vs. variables with a hierarchical structure of importance to their possible categories.  \n",

In this case, each subject might be **nominal**&mdash;given the same level of importance.

In this case, the class variable is **ordinal**&mdash;its values have an ordered, hierarchical structure of importance. \n",

For nominal data, it assigns unique numeric codes without implying any meaningful order. However, note that the order of categories might still influence the numeric labels assigned, and this depends on how the machine learning model interprets the data. Some models may treat these numeric labels as a meaningful ordinal relationship (like in linear models), while others (like tree-based models) may interpret them as distinct categories without implying order.\n",

    "Label encoding has the following disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unintended Ordinality: If label encoding is applied to nominal (non-ordered) categories, it can introduce a false sense of ordinality. This means that the model might interpret the encoded numbers as having some order or ranking, which may not actually exist between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difficulty in Interpretation: After label encoding, the categories are represented by numbers, which can make it harder to directly interpret the meaning of the values. For example, \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" might be encoded as 1, 2, and 3, but it becomes unclear what these numbers represent without referencing the original category labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact on Algorithms: Some machine learning algorithms (like linear regression) may treat encoded numerical values as continuous variables, which could be misleading if the data is nominal. For example, assigning \"1\" to \"North\" and \"2\" to \"South\" may incorrectly imply a numeric relationship that doesn't exist between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability: Label encoding can become problematic when dealing with a large number of unique categories, as it still assigns a unique number to each category, which can increase computational complexity."
