    "In this activity, you will practice structuring, an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** step that helps data science projects move forward. During EDA, when working with data that contains aspects of date and time, \"datetime\" transformations are integral to better understanding the data. As a data professional, you will encounter datetime transformations quite often as you determine how to format your data to suit the problems you want to solve or the questions you want to answer. This activity gives you an opportunity to apply these skills and prepare you for future EDA, where you will need to determine how best to structure your data.\n",

    "In this activity, you are a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into **unicorn companies**â€“companies that are valued at over one billion dollars.  \n",

    "You will work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help you draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, you will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. This will develop your skills in EDA and your knowledge of functions that allow you to structure data.\n",
