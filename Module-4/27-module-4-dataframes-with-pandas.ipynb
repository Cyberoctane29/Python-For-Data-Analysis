    "The air quality index (AQI) is a number that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality. Refer to this guide from [AirNow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/) for more information.\n",

    "In this lab, you will practice working in pandas. You will load a dataframe, examine its metadata and summary statistics, and explore it using iloc indexing and sorting. You will also practice Boolean masking, grouping, and concatenating data."
