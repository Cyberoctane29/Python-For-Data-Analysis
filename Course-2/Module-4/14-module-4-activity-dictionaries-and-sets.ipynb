    "In this lab, you will practice creating, modifying, and working with data structures in Python. This will develop your knowledge of different kinds of data structures and the different operations that you can perform with them to answer questions about the data. This will help you prepare for projects you may encounter where you will need to use data structures to store and keep track of data.\n",

    "In your work as an analyst, you are continuing your research into air quality data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The air quality index (AQI) is a number that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality. Refer to this guide from [AirNow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/) for more information.\n",

    "In this activity, you will create, modify, and update dictionaries and sets. You will also be working with more data than in previous labs to more closely resemble situations encountered by working data professionals."

    "Dictionaries, sets, and lists, along with list comprehensions, are essential for efficient data processing and analysis. Python's built-in functions like zip(), dict(), and set() simplify creating and manipulating these structures. Dictionaries are ideal for organizing data in key-value pairs, while sets ensure data uniqueness by removing duplicates. Using loops and functions, I can perform calculations on dictionary values and save results in lists, tuples, or sets for flexible processing. With methods like .keys(), .values(), and .items(), accessing and managing dictionary data is straightforward. These tools make data analysis clear, concise, and effective."
