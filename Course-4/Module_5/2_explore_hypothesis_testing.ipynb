    "\n",
    "- Despite small sample sizes, the variation within the data allowed for statistically significant conclusions at the 5% significance level.  \n",
    "- Los Angeles' mean AQI was statistically different from the rest of California, while New York was found to have a lower mean AQI than Ohio.  \n",
    "- We were unable to conclude that Michigan's mean AQI was greater than 10, as this difference was not statistically significant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Insights**:  \n",
    "- Python proved to be a powerful tool for precise and efficient sampling and hypothesis testing, thanks to its wide variety of libraries and methods.  \n",
    "- We successfully addressed three key questions from the company, analyzing the AQI data for different cities:  \n",
    "  - The AQI in Los Angeles County was not statistically different from the rest of California, indicating that any observed difference was likely due to sampling variability.  \n",
    "  - New York had a lower mean AQI than Ohio, with the difference being statistically significant.  \n",
    "  - Michigan is unlikely to be affected by the new policy, as its mean AQI being greater than 10 was not statistically significant and was likely due to chance.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Key Findings**:\n",
    "  - **Los Angeles vs. Rest of California**:  \n",
    "    The hypothesis test indicated that Los Angeles' mean AQI was **not statistically different** from the rest of California. The observed difference was likely due to sampling variability, and the p-value did not meet the threshold for statistical significance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **New York vs. Ohio**:  \n",
    "    Based on the test results, **New York has a statistically lower AQI than Ohio**, with a **95% confidence level**. The p-value was less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Michigan and the New Policy**:  \n",
    "    The hypothesis test showed that Michigan's AQI was **not statistically greater than 10**, meaning that Michigan is **unlikely to be affected by the new policy**. The p-value was greater than the significance level (0.05), suggesting that the difference was likely due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Setup**:  \n",
    "  For each test, I would explain the null and alternative hypotheses, specify whether the test was one-tailed or two-tailed, and describe the t-test configuration used from the `stats` module.  \n",

    "  I would communicate the conclusions based on a 5% significance level, highlighting the results for each of the research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Insights**:\n",
    "  - **Los Angeles AQI**:  \n",
    "    The hypothesis test showed that Los Angeles County’s AQI is **not statistically higher** than the rest of California. This suggests that air quality concerns may not be more concentrated in Los Angeles compared to other areas in California. **Resources and interventions might be better directed elsewhere** based on this finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Ohio vs. New York AQI**:  \n",
    "    Ohio’s AQI was found to be **statistically higher** than New York’s, with a significant difference between the two. Therefore, stakeholders should **consider New York for a regional office** if air quality is a factor in site selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Michigan’s Likely Impact by the New Policy**:  \n",
    "    The test results indicated that Michigan’s AQI is **not statistically greater than 10**, suggesting that Michigan is **unlikely to be impacted by the new policy**. The difference in AQI is not reliable enough to support action on the policy’s basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Statistics**:  \n",
    "  Providing sample statistics, such as the AQI values for Los Angeles, New York, Ohio, and Michigan, would offer stakeholders a clearer understanding of the data compared and the significance of the results. This helps contextualize the findings and enables stakeholders to make informed decisions.\n",
