    "For this activity, you are a member of an analytics team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). You are assigned to analyze data on air quality with respect to carbon monoxide, a major air pollutant. The data includes information from more than 200 sites, identified by state, county, city, and local site names. You will use Python functions to gather statistics about air quality, then share insights with stakeholders."
