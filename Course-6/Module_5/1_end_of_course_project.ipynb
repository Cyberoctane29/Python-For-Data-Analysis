Here even if the model classifies some opinions as claims its fine as in the subsequent processes of reviewing by human moderators or other processes it will eventually be tagged an opinion or the author wouldnt be tagged as being problematic. However leaving out vidos which are actually claims and letting them being tagged opinions(false nagatives or a type 2 error) is wrong as these claim videos tend to have malicious, misinformation, etc content which could have more negative implications,"
